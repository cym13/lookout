Lookout: binary visualization
=============================

What is it?
===========

Lookout is a reverse engineering tool that helps visualizing unknown data. It
provides useful insight by presenting a statistical representation that
allows quick identification of the different kind of data that are present in
any file. That representation doesn't rely on parsing and therefore works
just as well on obscure formats even when all other tools fail.

I strongly recommend watching `that video`__ from Christopher Domas about Cantor
Dust, a program he wrote and never released that servers the same purpose.

I used for some years another tool based on the same concept named Veles_
which I liked very much. However its authors decided to go in a direction
that drastically reduced its usability for me (unrealistic file size
limitation, slowdowns, dependency hell, mandatory application server,
clumsier interface...). I also missed some features like being able to
corelate hexdump and visual exploration in real time.

I still recommend the tool in its old ubuntu1604 version if you can grab it.
Furthermore their website is very well made when it comes to explaining the
different kind of graphs that it supports and how they should be interpreted.

Usage
=====

Lookout currently doesn't support any option. Call it as such:

.. code:: shell

    lookout FILE

Building
========

Lookout is written in D. If you have properly configured your development
environment with a compiler (dmd, ldc or gdc) and the Dub package manager you
can do:

.. code:: shell

    dub build
